### Gray Wolf Optimization
#### Description
The **Gray Wolf Optimization algorithm** mimics the leadership hierarchy and
hunting mechanism of gray wolves in nature. Wolves live in a pack. 
The average pack consists of a family of 5â€“12 animals.
wolves have strict social hierarchy which is represented by the division of a pack into four
levels: alpha, beta, delta, and omega.<br>
_Alpha_ wolves are the leaders of their pack. They are responsible for making decisions, but sometimes 
alphas can obey to other wolfes of the pack.<br>
_Beta_ wolves help alphas make decisions, every beta is a candidate 
to become an alpha if an alpha has died or aged.
A beta respects an alpha and transfers commands to the pack, ensures discipline among inferior wolves 
and provides a feedback from the pack to an alpha.<br>
_Delta_ wolves have to submit to alphas and betas, but they dominate the omega.<br>
Finally, _omega_ wolves have to obey all other wolves. Sometimes they play a role of caretakers.<br><br>
Gray wolf hunting has three main phases:
* Tracking, chasing, and approaching the prey
* Pursuing, encircling, and harassing the prey until it stops moving
* Attack towards the prey
#### Mathematical model
In mathematical model of the social hierarchy 
of wolves is mapped to the solution fit. The fittest 
solution is considered to be the alpha. Beta and delta are the second and
third best solutions respectively.
The rest of the candidate solutions are assumed to be omega.<br>
Alpha, beta and delta lead the hunting (optimization) and omega wolves follow these three wolves.

### Bat Algorithm
#### Description
The **Bat Algorithm** is based on the bats echolocation ability. By using echolocation bats can detect
their food and preys and even distinguish between the different kinds of insects in the darkness.
A bat emits a loud sound and listens to the echo which is created from the sound reflection from the surrounding objects.
Sounds emmited by a bat are vary in properties and can be used depending on the hunting strategy.<br>
Each sound impulse lasts from 8 to 10 milliseconds and has constant frequency between 25 and 150 KHz.
A bat can emit from 10 to 20 of supersonic impulses per second, an impulse lasts from 5 to 20 milliseconds.
The number of signals emited by a bat can be increased during a hunt to 200.
#### Mathematical model
The Bat Algorithm uses the following principles:
1. A bat uses echolocation for distance estimation and "knows" the difference between the food/prey and an obstacle
2. Bats fly randomly with a velocity of &nu;<sub>i</sub> in the position x<sub>i</sub>, fixed frequency f<sub>min</sub>, variable wavelength &lambda;  and loudness A<sub>0</sub> for the search of a prey. They can automatically adjust the wave length (or frequency) of emitted sound impulse and level of emission r &isin; [0, 1] depending on the proximity to the victim.
3. While the loudness can be changed by different means we assume that the loudness vary from big positive value A<sub>0</sub> to minimum constant A<sub>min</sub>.
In addition to these simplified principles, lets use the next approximations: frequency f from the segment [f<sub>min</sub>, f<sub>max</sub>] corresponds to the wavelength segment [&lambda;<sub>min</sub>, &lambda;<sub>max</sub>]. For instance, a frequency segment [20 KHz, 500 KHz] corresponds to wavelength segment [0.7 mm, 17 mm].<br>
For this tast any wave length can be used. Moreover, it is unnecessary to use wave lengths, instead we can change the frequency and leave the wave length to be constant.
#### Algorithm

BEGIN
Objective function f(x), x=(x<sub>1</sub>, ...,x<sub>d</sub>)<sup>T</sup>
Initialize the bat population x<sub>i</sub> (i= 1, 2, ..., n) and v<sub>i</sub>

Initialize pulse rates r<sub>i</sub> and the loudness A<sub>i</sub>
  WHILE count &lt; max number of iterations
    Generate new solutions by adjusting frequency, and updating velocities and locations/solutions
    IF rand &gt; r<sub>i</sub>
      Select a solution among the best solutions 
      Generate a local solution around the selected best solution
    END IF
    Generate a new solution by flying randomly
    IF rand &lt; A<sub>i</sub> AND f(x<sub>i</sub>) &lt; f(x<sub>*</sub>)
      Accept the new solutions
      Increase r<sub>i</sub> and reduce A<sub>i</sub>
    END IF
    Rank the bats and find the current best x<sub>*</sub>
  END WHILE
